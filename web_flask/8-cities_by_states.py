"""
Script that starts a Flask web application:
Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine
 (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
To load all cities of a State:
If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/cities_by_states: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage
    sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B> + UL tag:
    with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>
Import this 7-dump to have some data
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
IMPORTANT

Make sure you have a running and valid setup_mysql_dev.sql
    in your AirBnB_clone_v2 repository (Task)
Make sure all tables are created when you run
    echo "quit" | HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd
    HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db
