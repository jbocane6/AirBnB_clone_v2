"""
Script that starts a Flask web application:
Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine
 (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
To load all cities of a State:
If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/hbnb_filters: display a HTML page like 6-index.html
    which was done during the project 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static
Copy files 3-footer.css, 3-header.css, 4-common.css and 6-filters.css
    from web_static/styles/ to the folder web_flask/static/styles
Copy files icon.png and logo.png from web_static/images/
    to the folder web_flask/static/images
Update .popover class in 6-filters.css to allow scrolling in the popover
    and a max height of 300 pixels.
Use 6-index.html content as source code for the template 10-hbnb_filters.html:
Replace the content of the H4 tag under each filter title
    (H3 States and H3 Amenities) by &nbsp;
State, City and Amenity objects must be loaded from DBStorage
    and sorted by name (A->Z)
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
Import this 10-dump to have some data
IMPORTANT
Make sure you have a running and valid setup_mysql_dev.sql
    in your AirBnB_clone_v2 repository (Task)
Make sure all tables are created when you run
    echo "quit" | HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd
    HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db
