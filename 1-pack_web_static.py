""" Write a Fabric script that generates a .tgz archive from the contents
of the web_static folder of your AirBnB Clone repo,
using the function do_pack.

Prototype: def do_pack():
All files in the folder web_static must be added to the final archive
All archives must be stored in the folder versions
(your function should create this folder if it doesnâ€™t exist)
The name of the archive created must be
 web_static_<year><month><day><hour><minute><second>.tgz
The function do_pack must return the archive path if the archive has been
correctly generated. Otherwise, it should return None"""
